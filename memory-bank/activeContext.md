# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementation of Checkbox component binding and demo
- Expanding design system component coverage
- Following established patterns for component bindings
- Ensuring consistent user experience across components

## Recent Changes
- Created Checkbox binding in src/bindings/Checkbox.res
- Added Checkbox demo component to App.res
- Updated TabInterface to include Checkbox tab
- Implemented various Checkbox configurations and examples

## Next Steps
- Test the Checkbox component in various scenarios
- Ensure proper functionality for all states (checked, unchecked, indeterminate)
- Consider any additional design system components for implementation
- Update documentation as needed

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- How to best document the design system usage patterns
- Whether additional bindings are needed for the design system
- How to organize examples of component usage
- How to ensure type safety across the component usage

## Open Questions
- What is the full scope of the design system components?
- Are there any specific performance considerations for the design system?
- How should new components be added or existing ones be modified?
- What testing approaches should be used for component implementations?

## Current Challenges
- Understanding the complete API surface of the design system
- Ensuring proper typing for all component props
- Identifying best practices for component composition
- Balancing type safety with ease of use
