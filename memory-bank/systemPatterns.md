# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The application follows a component-based architecture using ReScript and React. It demonstrates the usage of the JusPay design system within this architecture.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **ReScript** for type-safe frontend development
- **Vite** for fast development experience and optimized builds
- **Design System Integration** rather than custom component development
- **Tailwind CSS** for additional styling flexibility and customization

## Design Patterns in Use
- **Component Composition:** Building complex UIs from design system primitives
- **Bindings Pattern:** ReScript bindings for JavaScript design system components
- **Props Pattern:** Type-safe component props using ReScript variants and records
- **Module Organization:** Separating component implementations and interfaces

## Component Relationships
- **Root Components:** Main application shell and layout containers
- **Design System Components:** Pre-built UI components from the design system
- **Custom Compositions:** Application-specific combinations of design system components
- **Binding Layers:** ReScript interfaces to the underlying JavaScript components

## State Management
- React's built-in state management via hooks
- Prop passing for component communication
- Type-safe state management using ReScript's type system

## Styling Approach
- Primary styling through the design system's built-in styles
- Tailwind CSS for additional customization
- Consistent use of design tokens from the design system

## Error Handling
- Type-safe error prevention using ReScript's type system
- Graceful component fallbacks where appropriate

## Performance Considerations
- Following React best practices for component rendering
- Leveraging design system's optimized components
- Attention to bundle size and code splitting
