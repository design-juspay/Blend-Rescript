# Product Context

## Purpose
This project serves as a demonstration and implementation showcase for the JusPay design system. It aims to provide developers with examples of how to correctly implement and use the design system components within a ReScript/React application.

## Problems Solved
- **Inconsistent UI:** Eliminates inconsistencies across the application by using standardized design system components
- **Development Efficiency:** Reduces development time by providing pre-built, tested components
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Simplifies maintenance by centralizing design decisions in the design system
- **Learning Curve:** Provides practical examples for developers new to the design system
- **Type Safety:** Demonstrates how to maintain type safety when using the design system with ReScript

## Intended User Experience
- Developers should find clear examples of component usage
- The application should showcase components in various contexts and configurations
- Implementation patterns should be easy to understand and replicate
- The application should demonstrate proper component composition techniques

## Key User Journeys
1. **Component Discovery:** Developers browse available components
2. **Implementation Reference:** Developers reference code examples for specific components
3. **Pattern Learning:** Developers learn composition patterns and best practices
4. **Design System Integration:** Developers understand how to integrate the design system into their own projects

## Design Principles
- **Clarity:** Code and examples should be clear and self-explanatory
- **Consistency:** Follow consistent patterns throughout the implementation
- **Completeness:** Cover all major components and use cases
- **Correctness:** Demonstrate proper usage according to design system guidelines
